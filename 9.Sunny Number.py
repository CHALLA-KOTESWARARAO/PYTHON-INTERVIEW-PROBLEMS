# 🌞 What is a Sunny Number?

# A Sunny Number is a number n such that (n + 1) is a perfect square.
# In simple words, if adding 1 to a number gives you a perfect square, that number is called a Sunny Number.

# A Sunny Number is always one less than a Perfect Square.

# 𝑛=(𝑥**2−1)
# For example
# 3**2−1=8
# 4**2−1=15
# 5**2−1=24

# So, 8, 15, 24, 35, 48… are all Sunny Numbers.
