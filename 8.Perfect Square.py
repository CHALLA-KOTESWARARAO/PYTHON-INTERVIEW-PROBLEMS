# A perfect square is a number that is the square of an integer — meaning, when you multiply an integer by itself, you get that number.

# 🔹 Definition:

# A number 
# 𝑛
# n is a perfect square if there exists an integer 
# 𝑘
# k such that

# 𝑛
# =
# 𝑘
# 2
# n=k
# 2
# 🔹 Examples:
# Integer (k)	Perfect Square (k²)
# 1	1
# 2	4
# 3	9
# 4	16
# 5	25
# 6	36
# 10	100

# So, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, … are all perfect squares.
